# Where the data comes from

Every feed HookEcho decodes, what it costs you, and how fresh it is. All of
it is public; nothing is proxied through a server of ours, because there isn't
one — the app talks to NOAA, the NWS and the rest directly from your machine.

"Latency" is how old the newest thing you can see already is when it arrives.
Cadence is how often a new one appears. Both are the services' numbers, not
ours, and both move around during busy weather.

## Radar

| Feed | Source | Cadence | Latency | Key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level 2 archive | NEXRAD Archive II on AWS (`noaa-nexrad-level2`) | one volume, ~4–6 min | minutes after the volume closes | no |
| Level 2 live chunks | `unidata-nexrad-level2-chunks` on AWS | sweep by sweep, seconds | ~30 s behind the beam | no |
| Level 3 products (NST, NMD, DVL, EET, HHC) | Unidata S3 bucket | per volume | ~1–2 min | no |
| Level 3 storm structure / hail (SS, HI) | NWS `tgftp` (`sn.last`) | per volume | ~1–2 min | no |
| N0B mosaic (multi-radar stitch) | Unidata S3, six nearest sites | per volume, per site | ~1–2 min; sites disagree by a scan | no |
| TDWR (44 airport radars) | Unidata S3 Level 3 tilts (TZ0–2, TV0–2) | ~1 min | ~1–2 min | no |
| MRMS national mosaic and fields | NOAA MRMS on AWS | ~2 min | ~2–4 min | no |
| ODIM_H5 (European radars) | decode only — open a file; no open live source | — | — | no |

Archive coverage runs back to **June 1991** for Level 2, and every WSR-88D plus
the 44 TDWRs are addressable.

Direct MRMS field layers expose a **Data source** inspector in Layer options:
the product path, provider, GRIB valid time, and complete-response receipt time
are retained with the displayed grid. Valid-time age and receipt age are
computed separately; neither is a measurement of provider ingest latency.
Issue/run times, provider latency, and undecoded quality flags remain unknown.
MRMS fields are labeled derived analyses. Failed refreshes retain the prior
grid's timestamps, and invalid GRIB timestamps produce an error. See
[the field migration note](field-registry.md) for scope and remaining work.

The existing 11 direct MRMS layer families now share a product catalog. Layer
fetches use its product-specific missing and no-coverage codes from the
[NOAA operational table](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/mrms/operational/tables.php),
so uncovered cells are absent rather than sampled as a measurement. The
precipitation-type value `0` remains the valid “no precipitation” class. Layer
search accepts source names (`NOAA MRMS`), units (`mm/hr`), and aliases such as
`NLDN` or `hydrology`. The source inspector also shows native product units and
value kind. Product paths and selectable rotation/lightning/hail windows retain
their existing mappings; this migration does not add new NOAA products.

## Things deliberately absent

- **Blitzortung lightning.** Its terms of service forbid use in an application,
  so it stays out however good the network is. GLM and the MRMS lightning
  density layer cover the gap from public sources.
- **A vendor "premium" radar API.** Everything above is a government or
  volunteer feed; there's no tier of this app that unlocks better data.
- **Any telemetry.** Nothing reports on you, your machine or your usage — there
  is no analytics endpoint and no server of ours to send one to.

  For completeness, the requests the app makes that are not feeds in this table,
  all of them optional or user-initiated: a GitHub Releases check for a newer
  version; the opt-in Anthropic digest, which sends the discussion text you
  asked to be summarized and needs your own API key; Google OAuth and Drive,
  when you turn on settings sync, into your own account's app folder; and the
  ntfy/Discord/Slack/Matrix push you configured, to the address you gave. Each
  is off unless you turn it on.

## Keys

The keyed feeds (Mapbox, MapTiler, Tempest, Weather Underground, Windy, mPING,
AirNow) are entered in Settings and live only in your own settings file. Without
them, those specific layers stay empty and say so; nothing else changes. No key
of any kind ships in this repository.
