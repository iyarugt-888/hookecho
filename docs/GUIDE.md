# User guide

Task by task: how to actually do the thing you opened the app for. The
[README](../README.md) is the tour and the feature list; this is the "how do I…"
The [browser demo](https://app.hookecho.io/) runs everything below except the
parts that need a filesystem or GPS.

## Getting oriented

First launch asks for one thing — your home radar — and offers to find the
nearest one from your location. It also offers a 60-second tour of the live map;
take it or skip it, and re-run either from the panel's **App** section, `Ctrl+K`,
or **Settings → General**. Everything else has a default and lives in
**Settings**. After that the whole app is a full-bleed map with three floating pieces — the
**panel** (site, product, tilt, every layer, window, tool and setting), opened
from the search pill top-left or the control column on the **right edge** (which
also carries the color scale for what you're looking at), and the **scrubber**
(the timeline, floating along the bottom). Tools you browse rather than watch —
settings, the event library, alert rules — open as pages in a slide-over
**drawer** on that same left edge, one page at a time, with a back arrow to the
page you came from.
Anything you click *on the map* — a storm cell, a warning polygon, one of your
own markers — answers in a card next to the click instead.

With the **Dock (ImGui)** theme, tools and Settings use dockable windows. Open Settings
to change its section, then use the window menu to dock or float it. Narrow Settings
windows use a section selector above the scrolling controls. `Ctrl+K` brings the Layers
search forward even when another dock tab is selected.

**If you remember one thing, remember `Ctrl+K`.** It searches the panel, and
Enter runs the top match. Every action in the app is in there, described in
plain English — products, layers, windows, workspaces, and "Fly to" for any
place name. You do not need to learn where anything lives.

## Watch a storm right now

1. Sidebar → site → pick the radar nearest the storm (or `Ctrl+K`, type the ID).
2. Product **Reflectivity (Z)** shows structure — where the rain and hail are.
3. Product **Velocity (V)** shows motion. Dealiasing is on by default, so a
   couplet reads as red against green rather than folding into nonsense.
4. Tilt: the panel's tilt row walks the VCP's elevation angles. 0.5° is what's
   near the ground; climb the tilts to see whether a storm leans.
5. The **LIVE** badge on the scrubber means you're on the newest scan. Anything
   that moves you off it turns it off; click it to snap back.

Moving the map: drag to pan, scroll to zoom. On a trackpad, pinch to zoom and
swipe sideways to pan; on a touchscreen, two fingers do both.

**Is it rotating?** Velocity, 0.5°, look for tight inbound (green) next to
outbound (red) over a few gates. Then turn on **storm-relative velocity** in
Layer options — it subtracts the storm's own motion, so rotation stops hiding
inside the storm's translation.

**Is it hail?** Reflectivity over ~50 dBZ is a candidate; confirm with
correlation coefficient (CC) — hail is non-uniform, so CC drops. The **storm
attributes** table (`Ctrl+K` → "cells") lists every tracked cell with hail size,
tops and VIL, sorted; click a row to fly there.

**Is it a tornado?** The tornado-debris signature is the three together at low
tilt: a velocity couplet, high reflectivity, and a *hole* in CC where debris is
lofted. The app flags candidates, but the three panels are the reason.

Turn on **Tornado detection** (Layers → Severe) to have the app read them for
you. It draws one marker per possible tornado (*possible*, *likely*, *debris* or
*confirmed*) with an evidence score out of 100. That score says how much radar
evidence there is, not a probability. Click or tap a marker to open the web of
rotation and debris detections behind it, each with its factors. The hover says
which pipeline made the verdict and when the sweeps behind it were scanned. It
alerts when a marker reaches *likely* or higher; *possible* is drawn but stays
quiet. It does not run on TDWR sites.

## Project a storm's motion

Search `Ctrl+K` for **Storm motion** and enable the tool. Drag from the storm's current
position to where you expect it to be in one hour. A magenta manual track shows its
projection and uncertainty swath. For a line of storms, click along the edge first,
then drag its motion. **Track manually** in a Cell analysis card starts with the cell's
automatic motion, which you can then edit.

Drag the origin to move the entire track or its hour-end handle to change motion.
While editing, Ctrl-drag holds bearing and changes speed; Alt-drag holds speed and
changes bearing. Shift snaps bearing to 5-degree steps. The motion card also edits
speed, bearing, left/right widths, cone angle, and time-marker spacing directly.
Ctrl+D duplicates the selected track, Delete removes it, and `[` / `]` adjust its cone.
These keys apply while the tool is armed or its card has keyboard focus. Text fields
and hotkey rebinding keep their input; otherwise, leaving the disarmed card returns
the bracket keys to pane navigation.
Use the primary pointer to edit. A two-finger gesture cancels a current edit before
navigating the map; existing tracks return to their position and motion at drag start.
Escape disarms the tool and cancels any unfinished edit.

The card estimates arrivals and closest approaches for saved markers and zones.
These are approximate projections from constant motion, not forecasts of storm
growth or turns. Tracks last for the current session; refresh them as the storm evolves.

## Look at four things at once

**Layer probe** reads the active layers at the pointer. Click the map to pin its card,
then expand a layer row to read source and time details. Fields with a full source stamp
include forecast/derived classification, run and receipt clocks, quality, and grid transforms.
Incomplete metadata is identified explicitly. Long cards scroll; **Unpin** releases the point.

Split into panes and give each its own product with cameras linked — Z, V, CC
and ZDR on the same storm at the same second, or one product at four tilts. It's
one action in `Ctrl+K` ("four products" / "four tilts").

**Cross-section**: click two points on the map and get the storm in profile —
core, overhang, and how high the echo goes. Any product.

**3D**: the volume as an orbitable raymarch. Drag to orbit, scroll or pinch to
zoom, set
a dBZ floor ("Only above" → *Hail core*) so cores stand alone. Drop **Quality**
to Low on a phone or an integrated GPU; it only changes sampling, not the data.

## Replay something that already happened

The timeline reaches back to **June 1991**.

1. Right-click the **LIVE** badge → pick the archive day.
2. Scrub. Warning polygons and local storm reports come along — what was
   actually in force at the instant you're parked on, not today's.
3. `R` replays the in-RAM decode buffer instantly.
4. Export what you're watching: screenshot, GIF, or MP4 loop.

Pre-dual-pol volumes (before ~2012 at your site) simply have no ZDR/CC. That's
the data, not a bug.

The **event library** has curated historic events; your own bookmarks sit beside
them. And the **verification lab** scores an office's warnings for a day against
the reports that came in — POD, FAR, CSI, lead times, and the reports nobody
warned for.

## Get told without watching

- **Markers** are what alerts watch. Search a place in the panel → **Save marker**.
- Settings → Alerts: chime, desktop notification, [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh)
  push, Discord/Slack/Matrix webhook. Triggers include warnings, lightning
  distance, rain arrival, debris signature and rotation. With **Tornado
  detection** on, a tornado *likely* or worse alerts on its own.
- **Android**: opt into the background service and your phone notifies you with
  the app closed, tiered watch / warning / emergency, tapping through to the storm.
  The home-screen widget shows what's warned at your saved locations.
- **Desktop**: tray-based background alerting, and `--serve` if you want the map
  as an HTTP endpoint.

## Make it yours

- **Color tables**: Settings → Palettes imports GRLevelX `.pal` and `.pal3`
  files, per product, and exports what you've built. A v3 table loads as the
  part v2 shares — its colors and stops — so anything v3-only is ignored rather
  than refused.
- **Themes**: 13 built in.
- **Keyboard**: every binding is remappable in Settings.
- **Workspaces**: save a pane arrangement (sites, products, tilts, overlays) and
  restore it in one command. Three ship — Chase, National overview, Analysis.
- **Placefiles**: the GRLevelX format, rendered natively, with per-layer opacity.
- **Plugins**: any command that prints a placefile on stdout. See
  [plugins.md](plugins.md).
- **Sync** (optional): sign in with Google and settings, locations, placefiles,
  palettes and keys follow you to your other machines, in your own Drive.
  Setup: [sync.md](sync.md).

## Out in the field

- **Chase mode**: live GPS as a blue dot, a storm-relative HUD with closest
  approach and escape bearing.
- **Offline chase packs**: pre-download basemap tiles for the area you're
  driving into, before you lose signal. Radar still needs data; the map won't.
- **Position sharing**: opt in and every HookEcho on the same network sees
  everyone's dot. Off-network, point it at a relay URL you host.
- **Streamer mode**: `F8` hides the chrome, `F9` auto-tours active warnings.

## When something looks wrong

- **Nothing loads.** The app talks to NOAA/NWS directly — check the network
  first. `--status` prints a per-feed report from the terminal.
- **A layer is empty and says it needs a key.** That's by design; it stays empty
  rather than nagging. Keys go in Settings, and stay on your machine.
- **The map is slow.** Lower the 3D quality preset, turn off animated wind
  (particles), and reduce the number of panes. On Android, close station cards
  you aren't reading.
- **Times look wrong.** Radar times read in *the selected radar's* local time,
  not yours and not Zulu. Settings → Units switches to UTC.
- **A forecast layer looks too good.** Check for the model banner — HRRR future
  radar, rotation tracks and smoke are model output, and the app labels them for
  as long as they're on.
- **Disk filling up.** Settings → Storage lists every cache against its cap,
  with clear and open buttons. Nothing cached is irreplaceable.

For scenario-by-scenario help (radar stopped, a tilt missing, folded velocity, time
mismatches, missing warnings, 3D gaps, missing tiles) see [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Still stuck, or something's wrong that isn't here — open an
[issue](../../../issues). Include the site, the product and the time you were
looking at; that's usually enough to replay it.
