//! Region-based Doppler velocity dealiasing — a simplified port of Py-ART's
//! `dealias_region_based`.
//!
//! Aliased ("folded") velocity wraps at the Nyquist velocity ±V_ny: a target moving
//! faster than V_ny reads as a value of the opposite sign. We segment the sweep into
//! regions of internally-continuous velocity (neighbors within half a Nyquist interval),
//! then unfold each region by an integer number of 2·V_ny steps so that velocity is
//! continuous across region boundaries. The largest region anchors at zero folds; every
//! other region is unfolded relative to the anchor.
//!
//! Region offsets are solved globally rather than by traversal order. Each pair of touching
//! regions is collapsed to a single voted fold difference plus a confidence — the number of
//! boundary gate pairs that backed it — and the sweep is solved along a maximum spanning tree
//! over those edges, strongest constraint first, followed by a bounded refinement pass that
//! re-checks every region against *all* its neighbours rather than just its tree parent. Folds
//! past a single interval fall out of the arithmetic, so multi-fold fields (very high-shear
//! tornadic couplets past 2·V_ny) no longer come apart at a thin early boundary the way the
//! previous greedy BFS could.
//!
//! ponytail: still one sweep at a time, no sequential second pass over the volume.
//!
//! Two things it does do beyond the simplest version of that idea. Region folds are chosen by a
//! *vote* over the gate pairs along a boundary rather than by averaging them: one stray pair on a
//! long boundary used to be able to drag the mean across the rounding line and fold a whole
//! region wrongly. And the anchor region can be tied to a reference field — the previous sweep's
//! already-dealiased velocity — instead of being assumed unfolded, which is what keeps a storm
//! that is genuinely moving faster than the Nyquist velocity from snapping back to zero folds the
//! moment it becomes the largest region in the sweep.
//!
//! ponytail: one previous sweep of continuity, not a 4D UNRAVEL-style solve.
