//! Germany's radar network from `opendata.dwd.de` — the one keyless international volume feed.
//!
//! DWD publishes every sweep of every C-band radar as a single-sweep ODIM_H5 file, no
//! registration and no key, which makes it the only foreign network this app can actually carry:
//! Environment Canada's Datamart has rendered GIFs only and keeps its ODIM volumes behind HTTP
//! basic auth, Australia's BOM volumetric feed requires registration, and OPERA's composite is
//! licensed. Bytes land in [`crate::odim`] and come back out as a [`Scan`], so rendering,
//! palettes, SRV and thresholds treat Essen exactly like they treat Oklahoma City.
//!
//! The five-minute volume scan is ten separate files per moment, one per elevation, and they are
//! *not* stored in elevation order — index 5 is the 0.5° base tilt and index 9 is the 25° bird
//! bath. Reflectivity has a `-LATEST-` symlink beside each file, which is what makes this feed
//! cheap to poll: no directory index, ten predictable URLs, fetched together.
//!
//! Velocity has no such symlink, and DWD's directory index is a megabyte of ungzipped HTML per
//! moment per site. It does not need one: every product of one elevation is named after that
//! sweep's end time, and the reflectivity file states its own end time in
//! `/dataset1/what/endtime`. So the velocity URL falls out of a file already in hand — see
//! [`crate::odim::end_stamp`] — and the same stamp names the dual-pol products, which are
//! fetched the same way for the same reason (their `-LATEST-` symlinks would let a fetch straddle
//! two volumes).
//!
//! Every build offers it. `opendata.dwd.de` sends no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, so the browser
//! reaches it through the same `/proxy/` route as every other feed (`crate::net::fetch_url`),
//! which puts a whole volume on the shared edge cache. That is real bandwidth, and it is the price
//! of a radar app that draws Germany in a browser.
//!
//! ponytail: no per-moment toggles and no partial retry — a moment that fails to arrive is simply
//! absent from the sweep, exactly as it was when this module fetched reflectivity alone.
