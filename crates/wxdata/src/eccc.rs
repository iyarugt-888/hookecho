//! ECCC — the public weather alerts Environment and Climate Change Canada has in force.
//!
//! Canada's alerts arrive as the same [`GeoFeature`] the NWS and MeteoAlarm ones do, so the panel,
//! banner, rules, watch radius, rollup and webhooks downstream need no idea a warning came from
//! Canada.
//!
//! # Why WFS and not CAP
//!
//! ECCC publishes the alerts three ways, and only one of them is usable here. The Datamart CAP
//! tree (`dd.weather.gc.ca/.../alerts/cap/`) is a date/office/hour directory of individual XML
//! bulletins with no index of what is currently in force, so finding the active set means walking
//! the tree — dozens of requests per refresh, and the recommended way to follow it is an AMQP
//! subscription this app has no business holding open. `api.weather.gc.ca` (OGC API - Features)
//! serves hydrometric, climate and marine collections but publishes no alerts collection at all.
//!
//! GeoMet's WFS does: `Current-Alerts` is exactly the set in force, every feature carries its own
//! polygon, and the whole of Canada came to 427 KB / 42 features on 2026-08-29 in under a second.
//! It is also `geo.weather.gc.ca`, already in the allowlist from the radar composites, so this
//! wave adds no host and no new trust boundary.
//!
//! ponytail: the whole country in one request, filtered to the view by the panel like every other
//! overlay. The server's `bbox=` parameter was tried and returns zero features (WFS 2.0 axis-order
//! trouble); at 427 KB for the country it is not worth chasing.
