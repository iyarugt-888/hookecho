//! MeteoAlarm — the European severe-weather warnings EUMETNET's members publish in common.
//!
//! Every national met service in Europe issues its own warnings in its own words; MeteoAlarm is
//! the one place they arrive in a single shape (CAP 1.2, wrapped in JSON) with a single severity
//! scale. That scale is the "awareness level": 1 green (no warning in force), 2 yellow, 3 orange,
//! 4 red. This module turns the levels that matter into the same [`GeoFeature`] the NWS alerts
//! produce, so the panel, banner, rules, watch radius, rollup and webhooks downstream need no
//! idea a warning came from Europe.
//!
//! # What this covers, and what it does not
//!
//! A CAP area carries geometry either as an inline `polygon` or as a `geocode` naming a region in
//! some registry. A census of all 31 country feeds on 2026-08-29 found 481 areas with a polygon
//! and 20545 with a geocode only — and the geocodes are in six different registries (EMMA_ID,
//! NUTS2, NUTS3, WARNCELLID, CISORP, FIPS). Resolving them needs a boundary table per registry.
//! MeteoAlarm publishes one, at `api.meteoalarm.org/metadata/v1/regions`, and it answers 401: the
//! metadata API is key-gated, and no key ships in this app. Eurostat's GISCO covers the NUTS
//! codes, but not EMMA_ID, which is most of them — and France's NUTS3 codes match neither the
//! 2024 nor the 2016 vintage, so even that half needs vintage archaeology.
//!
//! ponytail: so this ships the warnings that carry their own geometry, and skips the rest rather
//! than drawing them in the wrong place or guessing a shape. [`COUNTRIES`] is therefore the list
//! of feeds observed to publish polygons, not the list of countries MeteoAlarm serves — Germany,
//! Poland, Austria, Spain and Italy are all geocode-only today and are deliberately not fetched,
//! because their feeds are megabytes that would yield nothing. The upgrade path is a boundary
//! table keyed by EMMA_ID; the day one is publicly available, this list becomes every country.
