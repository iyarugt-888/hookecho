//! Process-lifetime counters for the numbers the perf work is judged on.
//!
//! Every later optimization has to show a before/after, and "how many requests did that poll
//! actually make" is not a question a profiler answers — it needs a count at the fetch site. The
//! counters are read by the app's Perf window, by `--serve`'s `/metrics`, and by a once-a-minute
//! log line in headless runs.
//!
//! On wasm every function here is an empty inline body, so the browser build carries no counters
//! and no bytes: the shared code paths are the same ones, and a native measurement of a shared
//! path stands in for the wasm one.
//!
// ponytail: flat atomics, no labels, no histograms — the ceiling is "which wave moved which
// number". A per-host or per-feed breakdown wants a real metrics crate, not more statics here.
