//! One number for "how bad is this storm", so a busy day sorts itself.
//!
//! The attributes table already lists everything the radar knows about a cell, but on a day with
//! thirty cells on screen the question is which row to click first, and no single column answers
//! it: the biggest hail is not always the rotating one, and the tallest top is often neither.
//!
//! The score blends the three things a warning decision actually rests on — the machine-learning
//! probability of severe (ProbSevere), how hard the storm is rotating (Vrot from the client-side
//! couplet detector), and how big the hail estimate is (MESH, which the Level 3 cell table
//! publishes as `hail_in`) — then nudges for the radar's own TVS/MESO flags.
//!
//! Components that are missing are dropped and the rest renormalized, rather than counted as
//! zero: a cell outside the ProbSevere feed's coverage is unknown there, not benign.
