//! One frame-level label placer, shared by every layer that draws text or a symbol on the map.
//!
//! Each layer used to keep its own `Vec<Rect>` and greedily skip anything that overlapped
//! something *it* had already drawn. Three of those existed, so a METAR plot could sit on top of
//! a city name and a river gauge on top of both: each declutter was correct and the map still
//! came out overlapped.
//!
//! This is the same greedy algorithm with two things added. The occupancy is shared, so a layer
//! sees what every earlier layer took. And a label that was drawn last frame is offered its slot
//! before any newcomer in its tier, which is what stops names flickering in and out while you pan
//! — without stickiness a label at the edge of a collision wins and loses on alternate frames.
//!
//! ponytail: greedy by priority, no annealing and no nudging labels off their anchors. A label
//! either fits where it belongs or it is not drawn.
