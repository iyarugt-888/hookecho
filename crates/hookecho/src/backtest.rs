//! Running one rule against an archive day, so the user can see whether it would have fired.
//!
//! A rule is a guess until something tests it. "Rotation over 45 knots near home" sounds right
//! and fires nine times a season or never, and the only honest way to find out which is to run it
//! over a day that already happened.
//!
//! Sequential and capped: this downloads and decodes real volumes, and twenty-four of them is
//! already a couple of hundred megabytes and a minute of CPU. Parallelising it would finish
//! sooner and make the progress readout a lie about what is downloading.
//!
//! Runs in the browser too — it is plain async, and the archive list and download both have wasm
//! paths. The only difference there is the cap (see [`MAX_VOLUMES`]) and that decoding happens on
//! the main thread, so a run is a series of brief hitches rather than a background hum.
//!
//! ponytail: one rule at a time, and decoding on the main thread on the web. Both are one loop
//! away if anyone actually wants a whole outbreak day scored at once.
