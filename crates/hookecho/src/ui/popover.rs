//! Cards that answer a click on the map, anchored where the click was.
//!
//! A storm cell, a warning polygon, a marker, a point forecast: none of these is a place you go,
//! they are all a thing you pointed at. Answering in a window that opens wherever egui last left
//! one — halfway across the display, over the storm you were looking at — makes the user connect
//! the answer to the question themselves. So these open next to the pointer instead, and stay
//! inside the map area rather than under the chrome that surrounds it.
//!
//! The anchor is latched the first frame a card draws and thrown away when it stops drawing, so
//! the card does not follow the mouse and a reopened card takes the new click, not the old one.
//! Nothing about that needs the caller's help, which is why it lives here and not in `app`.
//!
//! ponytail: `egui::Window` again, same reason as [`crate::ui::drawer`] — it already has the title
//! row, the ✕ wired to the caller's `open` flag, and a body. All this adds is where it lands.
