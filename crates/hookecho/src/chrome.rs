//! Caption, color bar and city labels painted into a finished render, on the CPU.
//!
//! A shared image has to say what it is looking at and when — a radar picture with no site, no
//! time and no scale is a pretty texture. The app draws all three with egui over the map; this
//! does the same thing for the off-screen renders the server serves, without a window.
//!
//! Why the CPU and not a second `egui_wgpu` pass over the same target: the renders are produced on
//! whatever adapter the box has, including lavapipe, and a text pass through the GPU is the part
//! most likely to differ between them. Laying glyphs out with epaint and blitting the atlas by
//! hand is a few dozen lines, has no adapter in it at all, and is byte-identical everywhere.
//!
//! Native only — nothing here is reachable from the wasm build, which draws its chrome the normal
//! egui way.
