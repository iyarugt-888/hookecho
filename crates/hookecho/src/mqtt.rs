//! MQTT publishing: what this app knows, pushed onto the broker the rest of the house listens to.
//!
//! `--serve` answers questions; nothing there pushes. Home Assistant, Node-RED and a shelf of
//! ESPHome things are all already subscribed to a broker, and an automation that waits for a
//! tornado warning cannot poll for it. Three topics, under a prefix the user picks:
//!
//! - `<prefix>/status` — the whole [`crate::status`] report as JSON, retained.
//! - `<prefix>/nearest` — the closest tracked storm cell to the home spot, retained.
//! - `<prefix>/alerts` — one message per delivered alert, not retained (an alert is an event; a
//!   subscriber that connects tomorrow must not be handed yesterday's tornado).
//!
//! Native only: a browser has no TCP socket, and the Android alert path is its own service.
//!
//! Credentials are a user secret — settings.json only, never the shots template, never logged.
//
// ponytail: one broker, one thread each way. Commands are three verbs (site, product, mute), not
// a remote-control protocol — anything richer belongs behind the HTTP server, which already
// answers questions.
