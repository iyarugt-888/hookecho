//! The address bar as a permalink.
//!
//! `#goto=` has been a link you could be sent since PR #76, and one the app read exactly once, at
//! boot. Nothing ever wrote it back — so the URL of a browser tab said where the session started,
//! never where it had got to, and copying out of the address bar sent someone to the wrong place
//! and the wrong hour.
//!
//! This keeps it honest: the fragment tracks the active pane, including the archive time when the
//! timeline is scrubbed off live. `replaceState`, not `pushState` — panning a map is not
//! navigation, and forty history entries per drag would make the back button useless.
