//! A workspace is an arrangement, and after R18 the arrangement includes the floating surfaces:
//! restoring "KTLX beside KDMX" but dropping the user back onto a bare map loses half of what
//! they saved. Only which surface was showing is recorded — not scroll offsets, not the drawer's
//! back-stack, which is a history rather than a layout.

/// this build cannot reopen simply doesn't reopen.
